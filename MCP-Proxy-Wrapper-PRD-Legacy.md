# MCP Payment Wrapper - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The MCP Payment Wrapper is designed to extend the functionality of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server by adding payment processing capabilities. This wrapper will allow developers to integrate payment functionality into their MCP-based applications without modifying the core MCP Server implementation.

### 1.2 Scope
This document outlines the requirements for developing a wrapper that takes an existing McpServer instance, wraps it, and adds payment-related tools while preserving all original functionality.

### 1.3 Definitions
- **MCP**: Model Context Protocol, a standard for communication between AI models and external tools/resources
- **McpServer**: The server implementation of the MCP protocol
- **Wrapper**: A design pattern that allows adding functionality to an existing object without modifying its structure
- **Payment Tools**: Tools that enable payment processing functionality

## 2. Product Overview

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The MCP Payment Wrapper will sit between client applications and the core McpServer, intercepting and processing requests while adding payment-related functionality. It will maintain full compatibility with the existing MCP protocol.

### 2.2 Product Features
- Transparent wrapping of an existing McpServer instance
- Addition of payment processing tools
- Preservation of all original McpServer functionality
- Configuration options for payment providers and settings
- Logging and monitoring of payment activities

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
- **Developers**: Will integrate the wrapper into their applications
- **End Users**: Will interact with the payment tools through MCP-compatible clients
- **System Administrators**: Will configure and monitor the payment functionality

## 3. Requirements

#### 3.1.2 Payment Tools
- **FR2.1**: Implement a `payment_process` tool that handles payment processing
  - Parameters: amount (number), currency (string), description (string), payment_method (string)
  - Returns: transaction ID, status, and receipt information
- **FR2.2**: Implement a `payment_status` tool that checks payment status
  - Parameters: transaction_id (string)
  - Returns: status, amount, timestamp, and payment details
- **FR2.3**: Implement a `payment_refund` tool that processes refunds
  - Parameters: transaction_id (string), amount (number, optional), reason (string, optional)
  - Returns: refund status and details
- **FR2.4**: Implement a `payment_methods_list` tool that lists available payment methods
  - Parameters: currency (string, optional)
  - Returns: list of available payment methods and their details

#### 3.1.3 Payment Resources
- **FR3.1**: Implement a `payment_history` resource that provides payment transaction history
- **FR3.2**: Implement a `payment_receipt` resource that provides detailed receipt information for a transaction

#### 3.1.4 Payment Configuration
- **FR4.1**: Support configuration of multiple payment providers
- **FR4.2**: Support configuration of payment processing options (fees, limits, etc.)
- **FR4.3**: Support configuration of security settings (encryption, authentication, etc.)

### 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements

#### 3.2.1 Performance
- **NFR1.1**: The wrapper should add minimal overhead to request processing
- **NFR1.2**: Payment processing should complete within 3 seconds under normal conditions

#### 3.2.2 Security
- **NFR2.1**: All payment information must be encrypted in transit and at rest
- **NFR2.2**: The wrapper must implement authentication and authorization for payment operations
- **NFR2.3**: The wrapper must comply with PCI DSS requirements for payment processing

#### 3.2.3 Reliability
- **NFR3.1**: The wrapper must handle payment provider failures gracefully
- **NFR3.2**: The wrapper must maintain transaction records even in case of system failures

#### 3.2.4 Compatibility
- **NFR4.1**: The wrapper must be compatible with all MCP clients that support tools
- **NFR4.2**: The wrapper must support multiple payment providers through adapters
