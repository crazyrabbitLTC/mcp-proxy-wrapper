# MCP Proxy Wrapper Project Summary

## Accomplishments

1. **Identified Issues with TypeScript Tests**
   - Discovered compatibility issues with the current MCP SDK
   - Found that the `_tools` property is now private
   - Identified changes in the tool method signature

2. **Created Simple JavaScript Tests**
   - Developed tests that don't rely on TypeScript type checking
   - Implemented basic assertions for validation
   - Provided clear pass/fail reporting

3. **Discovered Key Limitations**
   - Found that tools registered before wrapping are not intercepted
   - Verified that tools registered after wrapping are intercepted
   - Documented these limitations for users

4. **Improved the Proxy Wrapper**
   - Created an improved version that attempts to access existing tools
   - Added robust error handling for accessing private properties
   - Implemented graceful fallback when private properties are not accessible

5. **Comprehensive Documentation**
   - Created a detailed README with usage examples
   - Documented the API reference
   - Provided clear guidance on limitations and best practices
   - Created test summaries to document our findings

## Files Created/Modified

1. **Core Implementation**
   - `src/simple-proxy-wrapper.js`: Basic implementation of the proxy wrapper
   - `src/improved-proxy-wrapper.js`: Enhanced implementation with better error handling

2. **Tests**
   - `src/basic-test.js`: Tests for the basic proxy wrapper
   - `src/improved-test.js`: Tests for the improved proxy wrapper

3. **Documentation**
   - `src/simple-test-summary.md`: Summary of the basic tests
   - `src/final-test-summary.md`: Comprehensive summary of all tests
   - `README.md`: User documentation with usage examples and API reference
   - `SUMMARY.md`: Project summary

## Next Steps

1. **TypeScript Support**
   - Update the TypeScript definitions to match the current MCP SDK
   - Refactor the tests to use TypeScript when the compatibility issues are resolved

2. **Enhanced Functionality**
   - Consider implementing a more robust solution for intercepting tools registered before wrapping
   - Add support for more hook types and customization options

3. **Testing**
   - Add more comprehensive tests for edge cases and error handling
   - Implement automated tests with a testing framework

4. **Integration**
   - Integrate the proxy wrapper with the main MCP SDK
   - Provide examples of common use cases
