# MCP Proxy Wrapper Refactoring: Next Steps

This document outlines the next steps to complete the MCP Proxy Wrapper refactoring after reviewing and approving the initial implementation plan and examples.

## Implemented So Far

1. ✅ Created a comprehensive refactoring plan (`MCP-Proxy-Refactoring-Plan.md`)
2. ✅ Created client-server testing example documentation (`MCP-Client-Server-Testing-Example.md`)
3. ✅ Implemented the `TestClientServer` utility class (`src/test-utils/client-server.ts`)
4. ✅ Created an example test using the client-server pattern (`src/proxy-wrapper.example-client-server.test.ts`)

## Next Steps for Implementation

### 1. Update the TypeScript Proxy Wrapper

The TypeScript wrapper needs to be updated to remove any `callTool` functionality and ensure clean operation with the client-server pattern:

```bash
# Update the TypeScript implementation
npm run update-proxy-wrapper
```

Key tasks:
- [ ] Remove any mentions of `callTool` from the TypeScript implementation
- [ ] Ensure the `tool` method wrapping properly intercepts tool registrations
- [ ] Update documentation in the file to reflect the new pattern

### 2. Update the JavaScript Proxy Wrapper

Make the JavaScript implementation consistent with the TypeScript implementation:

```bash
# Update the JavaScript implementation
npm run update-proxy-wrapper-js
```

Key tasks:
- [ ] Remove the custom `callTool` implementation from the JavaScript version
- [ ] Add console warnings for deprecated usage patterns 
- [ ] Ensure the JavaScript implementation aligns with the TypeScript version

### 3. Run and Fix the Example Test

Now try running the example test to verify the new client-server approach works:

```bash
# Run the example test
npm test src/proxy-wrapper.example-client-server.test.ts
```

Fix any issues that arise during testing.

### 4. Update Existing Tests

Once the example test passes, update the existing tests to use the new pattern:

```bash
# Convert existing test files
npm run convert-tests
```

Key tasks:
- [ ] Update `src/proxy-wrapper.test.ts` to use the client-server pattern
- [ ] Update `src/proxy-wrapper.edge-cases.test.ts` to use the client-server pattern
- [ ] Update `src/proxy-wrapper.integration.test.ts` to use the client-server pattern

### 5. Update Documentation

Update the project documentation to reflect the new approach:

```bash
# Update documentation
npm run update-docs
```

Key tasks:
- [ ] Update README.md with information about the client-server pattern
- [ ] Add migration guide for users of the old approach
- [ ] Update API documentation to clarify the correct usage patterns

### 6. Clean Up and Final Testing

Perform cleanup and final testing:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Lint the codebase
npm run lint
```

Key tasks:
- [ ] Remove any deprecated or unused code
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass with the new implementation
- [ ] Fix any linting or type errors that arise

### 7. Create a Release

Once everything is passing and working correctly, create a new release:

```bash
# Create a new release
npm version minor # For a breaking change, use 'major'
npm publish
```

## Considerations During Implementation

1. **Breaking Changes**: The removal of `callTool` is a breaking change for anyone using the custom approach. Be sure to document this clearly.

2. **Backward Compatibility**: Consider if there are any temporary backward compatibility measures that can be taken during the transition period.

3. **New Features**: This refactoring provides an opportunity to add new features or improvements, such as enhanced logging, better error handling, or additional hook types.

4. **Performance**: The client-server pattern may have different performance characteristics. Monitor this during testing.

## Long-term Goals

After completing this refactoring, consider these long-term goals:

1. **Type Safety**: Further enhance type safety throughout the codebase
2. **Documentation**: Create more examples and tutorials for users
3. **Extensions**: Develop additional utilities that build upon the proper client-server pattern
4. **Integration Tests**: Add more comprehensive integration tests with other MCP components

## Support

During this transition, be prepared to provide additional support to users who may be affected by the changes. Consider:

1. Creating a dedicated support channel or discussion forum
2. Providing migration scripts for common usage patterns
3. Offering direct assistance for complex migrations

## Timeline

Aim to complete the core refactoring within 2-3 weeks, with the following rough schedule:

- Week 1: Update implementations and create examples
- Week 2: Convert existing tests and update documentation
- Week 3: Testing, cleanup, and release

This timeline can be adjusted based on the complexity encountered during implementation and testing.
