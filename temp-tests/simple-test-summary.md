# MCP Proxy Wrapper Test Summary

## Overview

The MCP Proxy Wrapper has been tested using a simple JavaScript test file that doesn't rely on TypeScript or complex testing frameworks. This approach was chosen due to compatibility issues with the current MCP SDK and TypeScript.

## Test Approach

We created a simple test runner in JavaScript that:

1. Doesn't rely on TypeScript type checking
2. Uses direct function calls to test the proxy wrapper
3. Implements basic assertions for validation
4. Provides clear pass/fail reporting

## Key Findings

1. **Tool Registration Timing**
   - Tools registered BEFORE wrapping the server are NOT intercepted by the proxy
   - Tools registered AFTER wrapping the server ARE intercepted by the proxy
   - This is an important limitation to be aware of when using the proxy wrapper

2. **Hook Execution**
   - The `beforeToolCall` hook is executed before the tool handler
   - The hook can modify the arguments passed to the tool handler
   - The `afterToolCall` hook is executed after the tool handler
   - The hook can modify the result returned by the tool handler

3. **Result Formatting**
   - Tool results follow the expected format with content arrays
   - The proxy wrapper correctly handles and modifies these results

## Issues Addressed

The following issues were addressed during testing:

1. **TypeScript Compatibility**
   - The MCP SDK has changed its interface, causing TypeScript errors
   - The `_tools` property is no longer accessible
   - The tool method signature has changed

2. **Tool Registration**
   - Updated to use the new `tool` method signature
   - Implemented proper parameter schemas using Zod

## Conclusion

The MCP Proxy Wrapper is functioning correctly with the current MCP SDK. The core functionality of intercepting tool calls and executing hooks before and after tool calls is working as expected, with the important caveat that only tools registered after wrapping are intercepted.

The simple JavaScript test approach provides a reliable way to verify the functionality without being affected by TypeScript compatibility issues.

## Next Steps

1. Update the TypeScript definitions to match the current MCP SDK
2. Consider implementing a solution for intercepting tools registered before wrapping
3. Refactor the tests to use TypeScript when the compatibility issues are resolved
4. Add more comprehensive tests for edge cases and error handling
