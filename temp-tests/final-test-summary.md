# MCP Proxy Wrapper Final Test Summary

## Overview

The MCP Proxy Wrapper has been thoroughly tested using simple JavaScript tests that don't rely on TypeScript or complex testing frameworks. This approach was chosen due to compatibility issues with the current MCP SDK and TypeScript.

## Key Findings

1. **Tool Registration Timing**
   - In the basic implementation, tools registered BEFORE wrapping the server are NOT intercepted by the proxy
   - Tools registered AFTER wrapping the server ARE intercepted by the proxy
   - This is an important limitation to be aware of when using the proxy wrapper

2. **Hook Execution**
   - The `beforeToolCall` hook is executed before the tool handler
   - The hook can modify the arguments passed to the tool handler
   - The `afterToolCall` hook is executed after the tool handler
   - The hook can modify the result returned by the tool handler

3. **Result Formatting**
   - Tool results follow the expected format with content arrays
   - The proxy wrapper correctly handles and modifies these results

4. **Private Properties**
   - The MCP SDK has made the `_tools` property private, which prevents direct access to existing tools
   - This makes it difficult to intercept tools registered before wrapping

## Improvements Made

1. **Error Handling**
   - Added robust error handling for accessing private properties
   - Implemented graceful fallback when private properties are not accessible

2. **Improved Proxy Wrapper**
   - Created an improved version that attempts to access existing tools
   - Added try/catch blocks to handle cases where private properties are not accessible
   - Provided clear logging to indicate when tools cannot be intercepted

3. **Documentation**
   - Documented the limitations of the proxy wrapper
   - Provided clear guidance on how to use the proxy wrapper effectively

## Recommendations

1. **Register Tools After Wrapping**
   - To ensure all tools are intercepted, register them AFTER wrapping the server
   - This is the most reliable approach given the current limitations

2. **Use the Improved Proxy Wrapper**
   - The improved proxy wrapper attempts to intercept existing tools
   - It provides better error handling and logging
   - It gracefully falls back to only intercepting new tools when necessary

3. **Consider SDK Updates**
   - If possible, work with the MCP SDK team to provide a public API for accessing tools
   - This would allow for more reliable interception of existing tools

## Conclusion

The MCP Proxy Wrapper is functioning correctly with the current MCP SDK, with the important caveat that only tools registered after wrapping are guaranteed to be intercepted. The improved version attempts to intercept existing tools, but this may not be reliable due to the private nature of the `_tools` property.

The simple JavaScript test approach provides a reliable way to verify the functionality without being affected by TypeScript compatibility issues.

## Next Steps

1. Update the TypeScript definitions to match the current MCP SDK
2. Consider implementing a more robust solution for intercepting tools registered before wrapping
3. Refactor the tests to use TypeScript when the compatibility issues are resolved
4. Add more comprehensive tests for edge cases and error handling
