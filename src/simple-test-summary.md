# MCP Proxy Wrapper Simple Test Summary

This document summarizes the implementation and testing of the MCP Proxy Wrapper using a simplified JavaScript approach.

## Implementation

We created two key files:

1. `simple-proxy-wrapper.js` - A simplified version of the proxy wrapper that:
   - Wraps an MCP server with proxy functionality
   - Intercepts tool registrations
   - Provides hooks for before/after tool calls and error handling
   - Supports short-circuiting tool calls
   - Includes debug logging

2. `simple-test.js` - A test script that:
   - Creates an MCP server
   - Registers tools
   - Wraps the server with our proxy wrapper
   - Registers additional tools after wrapping
   - Tests all tools to verify hook functionality

## Test Results

The tests successfully demonstrated:

1. **Tool Registration**: Both pre-wrapped and post-wrapped tools were registered correctly.
2. **Before Hook**: The before hook was called and could modify arguments.
3. **After Hook**: The after hook was called and could modify results.
4. **Error Handling**: The error hook caught exceptions and returned custom error responses.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

1. **Proxy Pattern**: We used a proxy pattern to intercept and modify tool calls.
2. **Hook System**: We implemented a flexible hook system for customizing behavior.
3. **Error Handling**: We demonstrated robust error handling with custom error responses.
4. **Metadata Support**: We showed how metadata can be passed to hooks.

## Conclusion

This simplified implementation successfully demonstrates the core functionality of the MCP Proxy Wrapper. It shows how the wrapper can be used to add custom behavior to an MCP server without modifying the server's core code.

The implementation is lightweight and focused on the essential functionality, making it easier to understand and test. It provides a solid foundation for the more complete TypeScript implementation with additional features and type safety.
