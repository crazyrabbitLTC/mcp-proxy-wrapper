# MCP Proxy Wrapper Test Summary

## Overview

The MCP Proxy Wrapper provides a lightweight wrapper around the MCP Server that allows intercepting and modifying tool calls. This summary documents the testing approach, issues encountered, and solutions implemented.

## Testing Approach

We've implemented two testing strategies:

1. **TypeScript Tests**: Using Jest for unit testing the TypeScript implementation
2. **JavaScript Tests**: Using a simple test runner for testing the JavaScript implementation

## Issues and Solutions

### TypeScript Compatibility

**Issue**: The MCP SDK's TypeScript definitions don't match the runtime behavior, causing type errors.

**Solution**: We've used `@ts-expect-error` in specific places where the SDK's types don't match the runtime behavior. This allows the code to compile while acknowledging the type mismatch.

### Test Structure

**Issue**: The original tests were trying to use real `McpServer` instances, which caused issues with the transport connection.

**Solution**: We've mocked the `McpServer` class in the tests to avoid the transport connection issues. This allows us to test the proxy wrapper's functionality without dealing with the complexities of the real MCP server.

## Test Results

All tests are now passing:

- **TypeScript Tests**: 7 tests passing
- **JavaScript Tests**: 5 tests passing

The tests verify the following functionality:

1. **Tool Registration**: The proxy correctly registers tools with the original server
2. **Hook Execution**: The `beforeToolCall` and `afterToolCall` hooks are executed at the right time
3. **Short-Circuit Behavior**: The proxy can short-circuit tool calls if the `beforeToolCall` hook returns a result
4. **Error Handling**: The proxy correctly handles errors in tool handlers and hooks

## Next Steps

1. **Documentation**: Update the README with the latest testing approach
2. **CI Integration**: Add the tests to the CI pipeline
3. **Edge Cases**: Add more tests for edge cases and error conditions
